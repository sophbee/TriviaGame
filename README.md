# TriviaGame

I used JavaScript and jQuery to make this trivia quiz while Bootstrap helped me with the framework. The main focus was to make a timer that would stop the game once it ran out. At the end of the timer or if the user clicks "Submit" before the timer runs out, the game will tally up all correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions and display the score at the bottom. This project was useful because it was a bit more complicated than the previous JS/jQuery homework due to all of the different components working at different times, but together in order for the game to work as I wanted it to. It was definitely a challenge making sure my JS stylesheet was neat and not verbose.
